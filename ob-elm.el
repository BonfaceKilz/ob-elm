;;; Commentary:

;; Org-Babel support for evaluating Elm code

;;; System Requirements:

;; All you need is Elm >= 0.90 installed on your system

;;; Code:
(require 'ob)
(require 'ob-ref)
(require 'ob-comint)
(require 'ob-eval)
;; possibly require modes required for your language

;; optionally define a file extension for this language
(add-to-list 'org-babel-tangle-lang-exts '("template" . "tmp"))

;; optionally declare default header arguments for this language
(defvar org-babel-default-header-args:template '())

;; This function expands the body of a source code block by doing
;; things like prepending argument definitions to the body, it should
;; be called by the `org-babel-execute:template' function below.
(defun org-babel-expand-body:template (body params &optional processed-params)
  "Expand BODY according to PARAMS, return the expanded body."
  (require 'inf-template)
  (let ((vars (nth 1 (or processed-params (org-babel-process-params params)))))
    (concat
     (mapconcat ;; define any variables
      (lambda (pair)
        (format "%s=%S"
                (car pair) (org-babel-template-var-to-template (cdr pair))))
      vars "\n") "\n" body "\n")))

;; This is the main function which is called to evaluate a code
;; block.
;;
;; This function will evaluate the body of the source code and
;; return the results as emacs-lisp depending on the value of the
;; :results header argument
;; - output means that the output to STDOUT will be captured and
;;   returned
;; - value means that the value of the last statement in the
;;   source code block will be returned
;;
;; The most common first step in this function is the expansion of the
;; PARAMS argument using `org-babel-process-params'.
;;
;; Please feel free to not implement options which aren't appropriate
;; for your language (e.g. not all languages support interactive
;; "session" evaluation).  Also you are free to define any new header
;; arguments which you feel may be useful -- all header arguments
;; specified by the user will be available in the PARAMS variable.

         (vars (second processed-params))
         (result-params (third processed-params))
         ;; either OUTPUT or VALUE which should behave as described above
         (result-type (fourth processed-params))
         ;; expand the body with `org-babel-expand-body:template'
         (full-body (org-babel-expand-body:template

    ;; actually execute the source-code block either in a session or
    ;; possibly by dropping it to a temporary file and evaluating the
    ;; file.
    ;; 
    ;; for session based evaluation the functions defined in
    ;; `org-babel-comint' will probably be helpful.
    ;;
    ;; for external evaluation the functions defined in
    ;; `org-babel-eval' will probably be helpful.
    ;;
    ;; when forming a shell command, or a fragment of code in some
    ;; other language, please preprocess any file names involved with
    ;; the function `org-babel-process-file-name'. (See the way that
    ;; function is used in the language files)

;; the context of the session environment.
